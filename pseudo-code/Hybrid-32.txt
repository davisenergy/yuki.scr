.At last, they’ve come for me. 
I feel their lives, 
their destinies spilling out before me. 
.The denial of the one true path, 
.played out on a world not their own, 
.will end soon enough. 
Soon there will be four, 
glorious in awakening, 
struggling with the knowledge of their true selves, 
.the pain of revelation bringing new clarity, 
and in the midst of confusion, 
he will find her. 
Enemies brought together by impossible longing, 
.enemies now joined as one. 
The way forward at once unthinkable, 
yet inevitable. 
And the fifth, 
.still in shadow, 
will claw toward the light, 
hungering for redemption that will only come in the howl of terrible suffering. 
.I can see them all. 
The seven, 
now six, 
self-described machines who believe themselves without sin, 
but in time, 
.it is sin that will consume them. 
They will know enmity, 
.bitterness, 
the wrenching agony of the one splintering into the many, 
and then they will join the promised land, 
gathered on the wings of an angel. 
.Not an end, 
.but a beginning.
